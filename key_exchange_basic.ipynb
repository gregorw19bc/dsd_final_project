    "\n",
    "Before diving into all of the potential subtleties and problems that will arise with this algorithm, let's look at a basic example, with reasonable numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine two people, Alice and Bob, who need to communicate something securely over an insecure channel. They need a way to share a secret number without anyone else figuring it out. Here's how they can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, they both agree on a public base, or generator, $g$, and a prime number, $q$. For this example, we'll choose $g=2$ and $q=11$. They'll also each choose a secret integer. Alice chooses $a=3$, and Bob will choose $b=4$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that they have these numbers, they each compute a public value, using this formula: $$ P=g^{secret} \\pmod q $$\n",
    "For Alice, this looks like: $$ p_A=2^3 = 8\\pmod {11}$$\n",
    "So Alice's public key is 8.\n",
    "For Bob, this looks ike: $$ p_B=2^4 = 5 \\pmod {11} $$\n",
    "So Bob's public key is 5. They now both share their public values to the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each person now uses their own secret integer and the other person's public value to compute this shared secret. Alice computes: $$ k = (p_B)^a = 5^3 \\pmod {11}$$ $$ k = 125 = 4 \\pmod {11}$$\n",
    "Thus, Alice gets her $k=4$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bob does the same: $$ k=(p_A)^b = 8^4 = 4096 = 4 \\pmod {11}$$\n",
    "You can confirm both of these results by running the following code blocks:"

    "Moving onto the other constant we will use, $g$ also has a few rules for picking it. In most cases, $g$ is picked such that as it is raised to successive powers mod $q$, it takes on many unique values before repeating. For safe primes, you can generally use $g=2$ as your generator, although you must make sure that $q$ is a safe prime, as we mentioned above, and make sure that: $$ g^{(q-1)/2} \\neq 1 \\pmod q $$ This just makes sure that $g$ doesn't lie in a smaller subgroup that could make the algorithm easier to crack. \n",
