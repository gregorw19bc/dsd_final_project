    "First is the function to convert an integer to a Python `bytes` object, which isn't very readable as you'll see, but many cryptographic functions take a `bytes` object as their input, so it's quite a useful conversion to have. The reverse is also important, to make the bytes mean something to humans. In math notation:\n",

    "In the code above, the `bit_length` function above returns the number of bits needed to represent whatever it is called on. We then add seven and floor divide by eight. This step converts the length in bits to the length in bytes, and rounds up to the nearest whole byte. The `'big'` argument makes it so that the array is a **big-endian byte array**. All this means is that they most significant byte comes first, and this is standard in moth cryptographic settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, big-endian is the order in which we store our numbers. For the number 2054, we store the 2 first. since it represents two thousand, which is the biggest number. All of our numbers are stored in big-endian order, so this should feel familiar, even if it's not immediately obvious when looking at a byte string.\n",

    "Within this byte representation, however, not all of the characters are ASCII characters, which can cause issues when transmitting data over email. Additionally, byte encoded messages are generally very long, so we convert the byte representation to Base64. This encoding contains all the same data, but in all ASCII characters, and in a more condensed format. The `decode` function is then used to convert the `Base64` number into a UTF-8 string, which can be sent over email.
